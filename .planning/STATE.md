## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Elixir/Phoenix for Push Server: BEAM processes for 10k+ stateful long-lived connections
- Redpanda: Kafka-compatible, simpler single-binary deployment for local dev
- Phoenix.PubSub + Redis adapter: cross-replica fan-out without manual connection registry
- Partition count = replicas × multiplier: independent tuning of intra-replica Broadway parallelism
